### [50 Projects to Save me from tutorials](https://github.com/haflettjm/SalvationFromTutorialHell)
**Description:**
  A self-directed engineering portfolio designed to eliminate dependency on tutorials. This repo contains 50 real-world, full-stack projects covering computer science fundamentals, backend systems, DevOps workflows, and distributed infrastructure — built entirely by me using Golang, TypeScript, and modern tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. PS: I've put off this project for more then 2 years I'm going to finish it darn it!


### [My Portfolio](https://github.com/haflettjm/haflettjm.github.io)
**Description:**
  A terminal style portfolio website that renders the content from markdown files. This repo contains the source code for this very site!

### [Universal Chat Bridge](https://github.com/haflettjm/UVCB)
**Description:**
  UVCB (Universal Virtual Chat Bridge) is a universal chat app bridge for connecting conversations across a wide range of messaging platforms—both popular and niche. It supports not just text messaging but also voice and video communication, allowing seamless cross-platform interoperability. The backend and bot support is written in Golang (working on VRc Integration soon).


### [Home-lab](https://github.com/haflettjm/home-lab)
**Description:**
  This repository manages the infrastructure, configuration, and application deployment for a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster built from scratch using physical machines in a home-lab environment. The project is designed to scale from lightweight workloads to production-grade services, with future expansion into cloud-backed hybrid infrastructure. It is written with the idea of deploying to a hybrid hosting solution!
