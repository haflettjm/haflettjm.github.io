# About This Site

This website is not just a portfolioâ€”it's a project in itself.

The site functions as a custom content renderer, built from the ground up to dynamically generate and serve its own pages using structured data. Each page you see is rendered through a bespoke system that ingests content definitions (written in JSON, Markdown, or custom formats) and compiles them into fully interactive, styled frontend views.

## Why Build It This Way?

Instead of relying on traditional CMS tools or static site generators, this site was designed to:

- Demonstrate full-stack control, from data modeling to UI rendering.
- Provide a customizable and extensible framework for showcasing projects, blog posts, and ideas.
- Explore how modern frontends can act as interpreters of structured content, not just static documents.

## Under the Hood

The site includes:

- A **custom parser and renderer** for DOM-like content structures.
- A **self-hosted data model**, where each page is defined as a set of nested components and attributes.
- Support for theming, styling, and dynamic UI behavior without hardcoding individual pages.

## TL;DR

This site is both a portfolio and the engine that displays it. A meta-project that renders itself.
