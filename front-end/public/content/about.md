# About Me

Hi, I’m **Jacob Haflett** — a DevOps engineer, cloud architect, and full-stack infrastructure builder with a passion for doing things the right way, at scale, and under pressure.

## 🧠 My Engineering Philosophy

I build with purpose: efficient, reliable, reproducible infrastructure backed by strong automation and observable performance. Whether it’s Kubernetes on bare metal or cost-optimized cloud pipelines, I approach every project like it’s going to production because eventually, it will.

I value:
• **Simplicity in tooling**
• **Clarity in documentation**
• **Zero-waste automation**
• **Infrastructure that explains itself**

## 🔧 What I Work With

• Building and scaling cloud-agnostic infrastructure  
• Automating environments with Terraform, Helm, and Ansible  
• Running Kubernetes clusters across hybrid setups  
• Monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana  
• Writing robust backend systems in **Go** and **Python**  
• Managing pipelines in GitHub Actions, GitLab, and Jenkins  
• Reducing cloud costs through right-sizing, visibility, and rethinking architecture

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Built This Portfolio

This terminal-style portfolio is a live demonstration of what I care about most:  
Clean interfaces  
Fast feedback  
Real infrastructure-backed thinking  
A bit of fun and aesthetic flair

## ⚡ What’s Next

I’m always building — whether it’s internal tools, open-source utilities, or the next piece of my homegrown Kubernetes lab. If you want to collaborate, hire, or just talk infrastructure, I’d love to hear from you.
